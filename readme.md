# Advent of code 2022

it's the time of the year, for another coding adventure! :christmas_tree:

Start your adventure of [adventofcode2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022)

You can use any programming language you want. They just want the answers and that's it. Whoever answered first takes the higher position on leader board. Here, speed matters in terms of your submissions to the questions rather than the speed of your programs.

There are 2 parts to every problem. The first part will be easier than the second one. It's important to have a scalable solution that you can reuse most of the code from part 1 and make less changes to finish the second part.

**Note**: This code is just for learning purposes only, please do not use it to get some
gold stars! Use your imagination and think through the challenges as they will
get pretty interesting going forward; in later stages the challenges will be more
complex and hard to solve.


Happy coding!
